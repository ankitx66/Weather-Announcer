The file contents in the provided code are as follows:

1. **Import Statements:**
   ```python
   import requests
   import json
   import win32com.client as wincom
   ```

   These lines import necessary libraries:
   - `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to the weather API.
   - `json`: Used for parsing JSON data received from the API.
   - `win32com.client`: Used for text-to-speech functionality using the Windows Speech API.

2. **User Input:**
   ```python
   city = input("Enter name of the city\n")
   ```
   
   This line prompts the user to enter the name of a city whose current temperature they want to know.

3. **API Key and URL:**
   ```python
   api_key = "faed162b821042f5aaf120432242406"
   url = f"https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key={api_key}&q={city}"
   ```
   
   - `api_key`: Stores the API key required to access the Weather API.
   - `url`: Constructs the API request URL using the API key and the city name entered by the user.

4. **API Request:**
   ```python
   response = requests.get(url)
   data = response.json()
   ```
   
   - `requests.get(url)`: Sends a GET request to the Weather API endpoint specified by `url`.
   - `response.json()`: Parses the JSON response from the API into a Python dictionary stored in `data`.

5. **Extracting Temperature:**
   ```python
   temperature = data["current"]["temp_c"]
   ```
   
   - `data["current"]["temp_c"]`: Extracts the current temperature in Celsius from the JSON response stored in `data`.

6. **Text-to-Speech Conversion:**
   ```python
   speaker = wincom.Dispatch("SAPI.SpVoice")
   speaker.Speak(f" Ahnkit The current temperature in {city} is {temperature} degrees Celsius.")
   ```
   
   - `wincom.Dispatch("SAPI.SpVoice")`: Creates an instance of the Windows Speech API (SAPI) voice.
   - `speaker.Speak(...)`: Converts the specified text (including the current city name and temperature) into speech using the Windows text-to-speech engine.

This code snippet essentially takes user input for a city name, retrieves the current temperature for that city using a weather API, and then converts the temperature information into spoken words using the Windows text-to-speech functionality.
